    The Diploma in Mechanical Engineering is a three-year program designed to
    provide students with in-depth knowledge of mechanical systems,
    manufacturing processes, and engineering design. This industry-focused
    curriculum equips students with the technical expertise needed to excel in
    the automobile, aerospace, robotics, and manufacturing sectors.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    The program covers fundamental subjects such as thermodynamics, fluid
    mechanics, strength of materials, machine design, CAD/CAM, and industrial
    automation. Students gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and
    technologies, including 3D modeling software (AutoCAD, SolidWorks), CNC
    machining, and advanced manufacturing techniques.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    Emphasizing practical learning, the curriculum integrates workshops, lab
    experiments, industrial visits, and live projects to help students develop
    problem-solving and analytical skills. Exposure to real-world challenges in
    mechanical systems and production enhances their technical capabilities.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    In addition to core mechanical engineering concepts, students are trained in
    quality control, maintenance management, and emerging fields like renewable
    energy and mechatronics. The program also focuses on soft skills, teamwork,
    and leadership, preparing students for a successful career in the
    engineering industry.<div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    Graduates of the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering have diverse career
    opportunities in automobile manufacturing, heavy machinery industries, power
    plants, aerospace, and research organizations. They can also opt for higher
    studies in engineering or entrepreneurship in industrial production and
    machine design.<div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    At Tula's Institute, students receive industry-relevant training, practical
    exposure, and mentorship from experienced faculty and industry
    professionals, ensuring a strong foundation for a rewarding career in
    mechanical engineering.
