    The Diploma in Pharmacy (D.Pharma.) is a two-year program designed to
    provide students with comprehensive knowledge of pharmaceutical sciences,
    drug formulation, and healthcare practices. With an intake capacity of 60
    seats, this course equips aspiring pharmacists with the necessary skills to
    contribute effectively to the healthcare industry.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    The curriculum covers pharmaceutics, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry,
    hospital & clinical pharmacy, and drug regulations. Students gain hands-on
    training in dispensing, drug testing, patient counseling, and pharmaceutical
    manufacturing. Practical learning is enhanced through laboratory
    experiments, hospital training, and industry visits to ensure real-world
    exposure.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    After completing D.Pharma, graduates can register with the State Pharmacy
    Council to become licensed pharmacists. They are eligible for employment in
    hospitals, retail and community pharmacies, pharmaceutical industries, and
    regulatory bodies. Additionally, students can pursue higher education by
    enrolling in B. Pharma through lateral entry (direct admission into the
    second year), opening doors for advanced career opportunities in drug
    manufacturing, research, clinical pharmacy, and pharmaceutical marketing.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    With the increasing demand for qualified pharmacists, this program ensures
    students are industry-ready and equipped with the knowledge to excel in the
