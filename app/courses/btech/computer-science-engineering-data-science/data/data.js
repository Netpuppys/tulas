    The B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering(Data Science) program is a
    four-year undergraduate degree that is focused on providing students with a
    strong foundation in data science. During the program, students will learn
    how to collect, store, process, and analyze large amounts of data using
    advanced techniques and tools. They will also learn how to apply these
    techniques to real-world problems in various industries.
    <br />
    <br />
    The program is designed to equip students with the necessary knowledge and
    skills to become successful data scientists. In this program, we offer a
    comprehensive curriculum that covers the fundamentals of computer science,
    mathematics, statistics, and data analysis.
    <br />
    <br />
    The present era is full of technological advances in almost all spectrum of
    life and we are flooded with enormous amount of data. There is an increasing
    demand of capturing, analyzing, and synthesizing this large amount of data
    sets in a number of application domains to better understand various
    phenomena and to convert the information available in the data into
    actionable strategies such as new scientific discoveries, business
    applications, policy making, and healthcare etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    Data science is the area where applications of various tools and techniques
    from the disciplines of applied statistics,mathematics and computer science
    are used to get greater insight and to make better and informed decisions
    for various purposes by analysing a large amount of data.
    <br />
    <br />
    The curriculum of this program includes courses such as programming, data
    structures, algorithms, machine learning, data mining, big data analytics,
    and data visualization. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to
    work on projects and participate in internships to gain practical experience
    in the field of data science.
    <br />
    <br />
    Upon completing this program, graduates will have a range of career
    opportunities in industries such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and
    many others. They can work as data analysts, data scientists, machine
    learning engineers, and data engineers, among others.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our program also emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in data
    science. We believe that responsible data science practices are crucial in
    ensuring the ethical and fair use of data. As such, our program includes
    courses that cover ethical considerations in data science, such as data
    privacy, security, and bias.
