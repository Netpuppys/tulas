    teaching-learning process, coupled with practical experience gained during
    Industrial Training in reputed organizations, equip our students to handle
    the challenges required by the software industry. In addition to mastering
    theoretical concepts of computer science practical skills, our focus is to
    prepare students to conduct research, via minor and major projects offered
    in the curriculum. Projects offered stretch across diverse areas like
    algorithms, parallel computing, computer security, artificial intelligence,
    computer networks, as well as interdisciplinary areas like human-computer
    interaction, applied machine learning etc.
