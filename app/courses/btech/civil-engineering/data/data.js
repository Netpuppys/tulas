    The Civil Engineering Department of Tula’s Institute came into existence in
    the year 2011. The department offers Diploma, Undergraduate, and
    Postgraduate programs in civil engineering. The Department of civil
    engineering offers specialization in the field of Structural Engineering in
    PG program. Civil engineers work to sustain the natural environment while
    creating and maintaining the built environment. Civil engineers are
    essential to provide the necessities of human beings like water, shelter,
    infrastructure and energy in more efficient and renewable ways. If one has
    the zeal to take a new challenge every day, civil engineering will be the
    right choice.
