    structures, software engineering, and computational mathematics,
    complemented by extensive hands-on experience in deep learning, natural
    language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning, and computer vision. The
    curriculum emphasizes a practical, applicationdriven approach through
    dedicated AI/ML laboratories, industry-driven projects, and internships,
    ensuring that students can seamlessly bridge theoretical concepts with
    real-world problem-solving.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
    To enhance technical proficiency, students develop expertise in Python,
    AI-specific frameworks (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn), and
    big data technologies, fostering competence in data-driven decision-making
    and scalable AI solutions. Additionally, the program promotes an
    interdisciplinary perspective, enabling students to apply AI/ML
    methodologies to diverse sectors, including finance, healthcare,
    manufacturing, and smart infrastructure.
    <div className="mt-2 md:mt-[1%]"></div>A key focus of the curriculum is
    ethical AI development and responsible innovation, preparing students to
    navigate the societal and ethical implications of AI systems. Through
    collaborations with industry partners, research opportunities, and exposure
    to emerging trends, graduates are well-positioned to excel in cutting-edge
    AI research, technology development, and industry roles, driving the future
    of intelligent automation.
