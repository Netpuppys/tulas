    innovation. These events cultivate the soft, technical skills, attitude and
    self-confidence of the students. Students are encouraged to participate in
    various activities like paper presentation, technical quiz, project design,
    project contests, sports, and cultural activities. Students are motivated to
    undergo In-Plant training and many industrial visits are arranged every year
    to get industry exposure. The department has also developed start-up and
    entrepreneurship eco system to inculcate the new idea.

    <strong>SPECIALIZATION IN INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    This Specialization covers the study of Internet of Things (IoT) products
    and services—including devices for sensing, actuation, processing, and
    communication to help students develop skills and experiences in designing
    novel systems. The Specialization has theory and lab sections. In the lab
    sections you will learn hands-on IoT concepts such as sensing, actuation and
    communication.
    <br />
    <br />
    The specialization will give the theoretical and practical learning of
    internet and communication protocols. This will help the students to develop
    heterogeneous applications in the field of the internet of things (IoT). The
    program includes the knowledge of various terminologies and protocols of
    IoT, WSN and machine to machine communication.
