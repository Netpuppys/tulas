                    The Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) is a four-year
                    undergraduate program designed to equip students with a
                    strong foundation in engineering principles, technical
                    expertise, and practical skills. The course fosters
                    innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving
                    abilities, enabling graduates to excel in various
                    engineering and technological fields. The curriculum blends
                    theoretical knowledge with hands-on training, preparing
                    students for industry, research, and entrepreneurship.
                    <div className="mt-4 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
                    The B.Tech program is structured to provide a balanced mix
                    of classroom instruction, laboratory experience, industrial
                    exposure, and real-world applications. Students are
                    introduced to fundamental engineering concepts in the early
                    semesters, followed by specialized subjects and electives
                    tailored to their chosen discipline. This ensures a
                    well-rounded education that not only builds technical
                    proficiency but also enhances analytical and creative
                    problem-solving skills.
                    <div className="mt-4 md:mt-[1%]"></div>A key feature of the
                    B.Tech program is its emphasis on practical learning.
                    Students engage in hands-on training through laboratory
                    work, workshops, live projects, and internships with leading
                    companies. Many universities collaborate with industry
                    leaders, research organizations, and government agencies to
                    offer students exposure to real-world engineering
                    challenges. This interaction with professionals helps
                    students develop an understanding of industry standards,
                    technological advancements, and business applications.
                    <div className="mt-4 md:mt-[1%]"></div>
                    The curriculum is continuously updated to keep pace with the
                    rapid evolution of technology. Subjects such as artificial
                    intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, renewable energy,
                    and automation are integrated to ensure graduates remain
                    competitive in the job market. The interdisciplinary nature
                    of the program encourages students to explore innovative
                    solutions and research opportunities beyond their core
                    engineering specialization.
