    A bachelor’s degree in agriculture is a broad-based program with a lot of
    promise. It covers topics such as food production, gardening, animal
    husbandry, rural economy and development, environmental health and so on.
    Other businesses may face layoffs, but agriculture will never be one of them
    because “food” is a basic human need. There will never be a recession or a
    slowdown when it comes to feeding the planet. Truly speaking, advances in
    technology, research, and inventions in this field have greatly expanded the
    scope of agriculture.
    <br />
    <br />
    A student pursuing B.Sc. Agriculture degree will study Agronomy, Soil
    Science, Horticulture, Plant Breeding and Genetics, Entomology, Plant
    Pathology, Animal Science, Extension Education, Plant Biochemistry,
    Agriculture Economics and Fundamentals of Biotechnology, among other
    subjects. The course is based on ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural
    Research) recommendations and is intended to teach students how to improve
    crop production in a sustainable manner while also providing a broad
    understanding of agriculture and allied fields.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>The primary goal of this program is to:</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
      <li>
        Instil subject-specific knowledge while also establishing a link between
        practical solutions and theory.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Encourage students’ personal development and self-confidence, which will
        provide them with opportunities to work in the agribusiness.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Using scientific and experimental evidence to make agriculture-related
        issues appealing.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Use practical applications and research to hone problem-solving skills.
      </li>
    </ul>
